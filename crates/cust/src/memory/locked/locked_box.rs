/// Page-locked box in host memory.

/// # Page-locked memory
///
/// Modern OSes have the ability to page out memory pages to
/// storage areas such as the disk to reduce RAM usage. However, this
/// causes issues with certain things such as asynchronous memory
/// copies because the memory may get paged out to disk while
/// the driver is staging a DMA transfer. For this reason, CUDA
/// provides functions for allocating page-locked memory that is pinned
/// to RAM.
///
/// This memory is generally only used as a staging buffer for memory
/// copies to the GPU. Significant use of pinned memory can reduce
/// overall performance as the OS is forced to page out more memory
/// to disk.
